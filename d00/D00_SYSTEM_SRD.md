# d00 System SRD

rescued from https://web.archive.org/web/20120622021304/http://d00system.com/index.php?title=Main_Page

This is the basic system reference document for the d00 System SRD. 
This is a core rules set for role-playing games based on a simple 
system using only ten-sided dice. Anyone can publish works derived 
from this system reference document, using the well-tested rules 
presented here, free of charge.  It is only necessary that you credit 
DwD Studios and include the creative commons license found at the end 
of the links contained in the table of contents provided below.

# The Basics

## Game Master

Within the scope of this SRD, the generic term "GM" will be used. You can 
use this term or you may substitute a term that is more specific to your 
game or setting, such as Referee, Narrator, etc. The GM's role is similar 
to game masters in many other game systems (role-playing non-player 
characters, setting up the scenes, narration, storytelling, judging 
attempted activities of the players, mediating combat, assessing modifiers 
to rolls, etc.) Note that there is one special rule regarding GMs in games 
made with the d00 System SRD: passive ability and skill checks (see below).

## Terms

For clarification purposes, the following terms are true:

* The terms "check" and "roll" are often used interchangeably and always 
refer to rolling d00 and trying to roll less than or equal to some listed 
ability or skill score.
* Any check/roll made by the player against an ability or skill score 
constitutes an "action" and is therefore affected by any rule which refers 
to an action. Rolls made passively by the GM without the player's knowledge 
(even if using scores on the player's character sheet) do not count as an 
action. Some other types of rolls which do not count as an action: 
initiative, damage.


## Dice Notation

The d00 system uses 10-sided dice for all resolution mechanics. Since only 
10-sided dice are used, standard gaming conventions of 1d10, 2d10, etc. can 
optionally be replaced by a capital "D", as in 1D, 2D, etc. This should be 
standardized in the product derived from this work (either all uses follow 
one convention or all uses follow the other). Therefore the following die 
notations are acceptable:

**Die codes and their meanings**

* #d5 or #D/2   \
  Roll a number ("#") of ten-sided dice and divide the result in half, rounding up. Produces a result from 1-5.
* #d10 or #D    \
  Roll a number ("#") of ten-sided dice and sum them up. 3d10 (or 3D) for instance, results in a number from 3-30.
* d00 or D00
    * Roll two ten-sided dice. The first die is read as the tens digit while the second die is read as the ones digit.
    * Results are read as a percent. For instance, a roll of 0 followed by 7 is 7%. A roll of 5 followed by 2 is 52%.
    * Special Note: in some game systems, percent rolls like this treat a roll of 00 as 100%. In this system, 00 is 0%.

Die rolls are expressed in the format:

`[#] die type [+/- modifiers]`

> Example: 3d10+2 means: "Roll 3 ten sided dice. Add the result of the three dice together. Add 2."

## Rounding Fractions

In general, if you wind up with a fraction while calculating anything related 
to character creation or game play, round in the favor of your character.

## Basic Task Resolution

There are two basic ways a character will resolve tasks: ability checks and 
skill checks. These are used to accomplish actions and/or to resist effects.

### Ability checks

To make an ability check, roll d00 and you must roll less than or equal to 
your ability score (explained in the abilities section).

### Skill checks

To make a skill check, roll d00 and you must roll less than or equal to your 
skill score (which is explained in the skills section). See the skills section 
for more information, and for details on attempting skills without necessary 
skill levels.

### Resistance Checks

A resistance check is a special kind of ability or skill check. Resistance 
checks are designed to allow a character a chance to shrug off certain baneful 
effects. They are handled like any other ability or skill check, and are 
special to each circumstance. A resistance check does count as an action, 
and players bombarding an enemy with actions which require resistance checks 
is one way to whittle down a strong foe's attention and keep him from killing 
the party.

For instance, a grenade might be listed as causing a certain amount of damage, 
"half damage with a successful AGL check." That is an AGL-based resistance roll. 
As another example, a mystical effect might specify that the target of the 
effect becomes dazed and confused, unable to act "unless they succeed in a WIL 
check." In these cases, even if the term "resistance check" isn't specified, 
the roll is treated as one. When a character performs a resistance roll, the 
GM and player may explain how the resistance check appears. For instance, in 
the grenade example above the GM might specify that the player dives prone 
behind a nearby rock. In the mystical effect, the GM or player might say that 
the character screams through gritted teeth "GET OUT OF MY HEAD" while he 
whacks at the creature responsible for the mental assault.

**Dodging in Combat -** One very typical type of resistance check is dodging 
in combat. This is often called a "dodge" within the rules, but is in fact 
just one common example of a resistance check. When an opponent scores a hit 
on a target, the target may opt to perform a resistance check in the form of 
a dodge. This is done with an AGL check, success meaning the target has 
avoided the attack. Of course, dodging multiple attackers is progressively 
difficult (as is dodging and attacking in the same turn) because of the 
multi-action penalty, but that's what makes experienced agile characters 
truly elite.

**Disadvantage -** Sometimes a resistance check will be specially penalized 
by a significant disadvantage (that is, some types of effects are more 
difficult to resist in certain ways than others). This is known as being at 
a "disadvantage". For instance, a character trying to dodge a bullet is at 
a disadvantage over dodging a thrust from a spear; both can be deadly but 
the bullet is by far more difficult to see, anticipate, time, and avoid. 
In such a case a resistance roll will use one half the appropriate ability 
as the base chance to resist.

Being at a resistance disadvantage is common in combat under these 
circumstances: if the defender is unarmed but is trying to dodge a melee 
attack from an armed attacker; or if the defender is trying to dodge a shot 
from an aimed firearm. Note that there are exceptions to this rule: a burst 
from an automatic weapon is different than an aimed shot and therefore might 
have its own rules.

### Passive Ability and Skill Checks

If the GM wants to know if a player's character notices or knows something, 
he may make an ability or skill check (see below) and describe the results 
of that check to the players. This happens without any effort by the player, 
and therefore doesn't count as an action. The GM does not simply say "Give 
me a Knowledge: Occult check" or "Make a perception roll". Having the GM 
perform these types of passive rolls removes any ambiguity over what 
constitutes an action.

### Modifiers

The GM can assign any bonuses or penalties the situation warrants. Specific 
modifiers may be given in rules. A modifier is applied to the ability score 
or skill score before dice are rolled. For example, a STR of 65 with a 
modifier of -20 means the ability check has a 45% chance to succeed.

**Categorized success modifiers:** For ad-hoc modifier application, GMs may 
assess the situation and apply one of the following categorized success 
modifiers.

| Difficulty | Modifier |
|--:|:--|
| Easy         | +20 modifier |
| Normal       | no modifier |
| Challenging  | -10 modifier |
| Hard         | -20 modifier |
| Very Hard    | -30 modifier |
| Improbable   | -40 modifier |
| Yeah, right  | -50 modifier |

## Additional Considerations

The following represents additional rules that are part of the d00 System 
and should be employed by products derived from this SRD.

### Automatic success/failure

Regardless of the calculated chance of success, any reasonable action check 
succeeds on any roll of 00-05. Similarly, any action with a reasonable risk 
of failure will do so on any roll 95-99.

### Critical success/failure

Any time you roll doubles (00, 11, 22, 33, etc.) and succeed in your roll, 
you have succeeded critically. A critical success means something beneficial 
occurred, decided by the GM or by specified rules. Any time you roll doubles 
(77, 88, 99, etc.) and fail, you have failed critically. A critical failure 
means something baneful occurred, decided by the GM or by specified rules.

### Contests

When two people are pitting their talents and/or training against one another, 
this is called an action contest. Action contests work just like normal task 
resolution. The GM determines which ability or skill is appropriate (might be 
same or different for each contestant). Both parties make a roll. If one 
succeeds and the other fails, the victor is obvious. Otherwise, play continues 
until there is a clear victor.

### Cooperation

When multiple people coordinate their efforts, the person with the highest 
chance of success is referred to as the acting character. Anyone helping is 
referred to as a helper only if his calculated chance of success is within 20 
of the acting characterâ€™s chance of success. The acting character's player rolls 
for success, with a bonus of +10 to his roll for each helper. The GM may decide 
that there is a limit to how much help one person can receive based on the 
situation.

### Multi-Actions

Any roll/check made by the player against an ability or skill is called an action. 
The first action you attempt in a turn uses whatever chance of success exists for 
that action (no penalty). Your second action is at a -20. Your third action is at 
a -40, your third at -60, etc. You can therefore attempt as many actions as you 
wish until the penalty is too steep for you to attempt anything further. The 
actions are considered to be simultaneous or in direct sequence, so players 
can't just come back at the end of a turn and announce they want their character 
to try five or six other things hoping to just roll luckily. Note that resistance 
checks do count as actions and do carry a multi-action penalty.

### Extended Actions

An extended action will require a number of successes in order to succeed. For 
instance, lock-picking a security lock might require a 2-point extended action. 
Another (more complex) security lock might require a 3-point extended action, 
etc.

Each turn, the character is permitted to make a check (the GM will decide which 
type of check it is). If he succeeds, he gets a point. If he fails, he loses a 
point (if he has any to lose). Once he's accumulated enough points to fulfill 
the needs of the extended action, he's finally succeeded in that action. Of 
course, if his chance to succeed is quite low, he player will likely give up 
trying before succeeding in a long extended action.

Note that the character can skip a turn if he has to accomplish something 
unrelated, then continue where he left off. For instance, a character working 
a few turns on a 3-point extended lock pick might have to stop his efforts for 
one turn while he shoots at some goons. That turn he neither gains or loses a 
point. Next turn he can continue as normal. However, some actions might reset 
themselves with an interruption. The GM should inform the player of such a 
situation before they decide they wish to interrupt their activities.

Extended actions only apply in combat; when outside of a combat situation, any 
task is resolved with a single roll of the dice â€“ even extended actions.

# Abilities

All characters have scores in the following eight abilities (sometimes called 
characteristics or ability scores):

## Abilities

The following is the standard core ability set for games using the d00 System SRD.

### Strength

This ability represents raw power and muscle, developed or natural. A character 
with a high score can punch harder or lift greater weights than his weakling 
friends. Characters with high strength tend to look the part, having well-developed 
physiques that do not go unnoticed. Strength is a physical ability and is 
abbreviated STR.

### Endurance

This ability represents stamina and energy. A character with a high score can 
recover from exhaustion quicker, resist toxins better, or endure pain longer than 
his wimpy friends. Endurance also represents resistance to damage before the body 
shuts down from trauma (that is, it is used to determine Body Points). Endurance 
is a physical ability and is abbreviated END.

### Dexterity

This ability represents general hand-eye coordination. A character with a high 
score can aim better or pick a pocket defter than his clumsy friends. Although 
very beneficial in combat, dexterity is no more important to a warrior than the 
other physical abilities. Dexterity is a physical ability and is abbreviated DEX.

### Agility

This ability represents quickness of the body, its balance, grace, flexibility 
and maneuverability. It is the celerity with which that messages from the brain 
are acted upon, and the general fluidity of motion of the bodyâ€™s muscles. 
Characters with high scores in agility tend to be the fastest runners, best 
dodgers, and the first one to act in a tense situation. Agility is a physical 
ability and is abbreviated AGL.

### Perception

This ability represents the five senses, in addition to raw intuition. A 
character with a high score can sense the presence of an enemy in a concealed 
location, guess the whereabouts of a proverbial needle in a haystack, or sense 
the weak spot in an enemy's defenses. Characters with high ratings in perception 
tend not to be surprised in ambush situations and are often sent ahead of a group 
to scout for his dull-witted friends. Perception is a mental ability and is 
abbreviated PER.

### Logic

This ability represents knowledge and the powers of deductive reasoning. 
Characters with high scores in logic tend to learn faster, remember better, 
break complex ciphers faster, and program computers more effectively than 
their stupid friends. Logic is a mental ability and is abbreviated LOG.

### Charisma

This ability represents the character's personality, charm, wit, and fellowship. 
Characters with high scores in charisma tend to make friends easier, persuade 
more effectively, and get along well with others more effortlessly than their 
jerk friends. Charisma is a mental ability and is abbreviated CHA

### Willpower

This ability represents the strength of a character's personality, his presence, 
leadership, and ability through direct or indirect intentions to inspire others 
to act, either out of respect, fear, or some combination of the two. Characters 
with high scores in willpower tend to rise in military ranks faster, interrogate 
more effectively, endure mental duress better, and attract followers more easily 
than their weak-willed friends. Willpower is a mental ability and is abbreviated 
WIL.

## Lite Ability Set

In some game genres, a smaller/simpler ability set may be desired. If this is 
desired, the following "lite" ability set can be used:

| Ability | Abbr. | Description |
|:--|:---:|:---|
| Strength   | STR  | treat this as a combination of STR and END from above. |
| Dexterity  | DEX  | treat this as a combination of DEX and AGL from above. |
| Logic      | LOG  | treat this as a combination of PER and LOG from above. |
| Willpower  | WIL  | treat this as a combination of CHA and WIL from above. |

## Scores

Scores are rated as a percent. Each score generally ranges from 35% - 75% for 
starting characters in a game which simulates any level of reality. Scores 
above 100 are possible.

### Starting Ability Scores

Individual games created using this d00 System SRD can have their own ability 
score generation methods. As an example, the following can be used.

Roll d00 on the random ability score table once for each of the eight abilities, 
then arrange them as desired to help meet an envisioned character concept:

| d00 | Score | Comments |
|:--|:---:|:---|
|00-09 | 35% | Feeble |
|10-19 | 40% | Low |
|20-34 | 45% | Below Average |
|35-54 | 50% | Typical |
|55-69 | 55% | Above Average |
|70-79 | 60% | High |
|80-89 | 65% | Good |
|90-94 | 70% | Excellent |
|95-99 | 75% | Remarkable |

## Derived Abilities

In addition to the primary abilities (or the lite ability set) defined above, 
characters in games created from the d00 System SRD have a few other abilities 
which are derived from those described above. These are called derived abilities.

### Body Points

Body Points (abbreviated BP) is simply the number of points of damage your 
character can sustain before he falls unconscious (or worse!). Body Points are 
calculated by using half the character's END score (if using the lite ability 
set, half the STR score). When a character reaches 0 BP, he is unconscious. 
When the action is over, the character must make an END check to awaken with 
1 BP. If the check is failed, the character is dead.

For instance, a character with an END score of 55 has 28 BP.

### Initiative

Most characters have an initiative score of 1. This is the number of dice rolled 
to determine who goes first in combat. Very perceptive characters (PER 65% or 
higher) or very quick characters (AGL 65% or higher) have an initiative score of 
A character who is both very quick and very perceptive (both scores 65% or 
higher) has a 3 initiative score and is extraordinarily fast. Initiative is 
explained more in the combat section.

Note that if using the lite ability set, LOG and AGL are used to determine Initiative.

### Movement

Time and distance can vary among games created using the d00 System SRD. One game 
might use meters per turn, another might use feet per second, etc. Still others 
might use an abstract unit of "spaces" per turn, designed for miniature use. 
Because of this, individual games will have totally different measurements of time 
and distance for movement considerations. What follows is a well-tested default 
movement resolution system that can serve as a default for any game derived from 
this SRD.

Characters have movement rates listed in three values: normal, fast, and hourly. 
A character who is moving normally is walking. Characters may move this walking 
distance in a combat turn for free. A player who wants his character to move faster 
must make an AGL check. If he succeeds, he may move up to his fast movement rate, 
but if he fails, he moves only twice his normal rate.

> For instance, a character might have a movement rate of 10m/turn, 30m/turn, 5kph. 
> He may move up to 10 meters for free. If the player wants to move further, he makes 
> an AGL check. If he succeeds, he'll move 30 meters. If he fails, he'll move only 
> 20 meters (twice his normal rate).

The character's hourly rate is for exploring on larger scale maps. It assumes a 
cautious pace. If a player wishes his character to increase his rate, he may make 
an END check. If he succeeds, he can double his hourly rate. If he fails, he moves 
his normal hourly rate.

### Melee Damage Modifier

When using melee weapons or bare hands, characters who are very strong will hurt 
their enemies more than characters who are very weak. Therefore, melee damage is 
modified by a character's Strength score according to the following table.

### Ranged Damage Modifier

When using ranged weapons such as bows or firearms, characters who are very dextrous 
will hurt their enemies more than characters who are very uncoordinated, by hitting 
them more effectively. Therefore, ranged damage is modified by a character's Dexterity 
score according to the following table.

| Ability | Damage Modifier |
|:--|:---:|
| 01-05	 | -5 |
| 06-15	 | -4 |
| 16-25	 | -3 |
| 26-35	 | -2 |
| 36-45	 | -1 |
| 46-55	 | +0 |
| 56-65	 | +1 |
| 66-75	 | +2 |
| 76-85	 | +3 |
| 86-95	 | +4 |
| 96-105 | 	+5 |
| Each +10 | 	+1 |

# Fields of Study

Any d00 game system has several fields of study. A field of study is a category of talent 
and training. Most games should have at least 4, and no upper limit exists. A field of 
study (sometimes abbreviated "FoS") organizes the skill list for the game. Within each 
field of study will be a list of skills (which are also broad in scope, see the skills 
section).

There is no specified list that is core to d00 system SRD. The only fact which is "core" 
is that there must exist at least 4 fields of study.

## Primary and Secondary Fields of Study

Each character will have one field of study which is primary to his player's character 
concept. When calculating the skill score of any/all skills within a character's primary 
field of study, a bonus of +20 is applied.

Depending on the number of fields of study used in the game/setting, the character may 
also have one or more fields of study which are secondary to his player's character 
concept. Skill scores for skills under a secondary field of study receive a bonus of +10. 
The number of secondary fields of study a character is given can be determined from the 
following guidelines:

* In a game with 4 fields of study â€” characters have no secondary fields of study.
* In a game with 5-6 fields of study â€” characters have 1 secondary field of study.
* In a game with 7-8 fields of study â€” characters have 2 secondary fields of study.
* In a game with 9-12 fields of study â€” characters have 3 secondary fields of study.
* In a game with 13-16 fields of study â€” characters have 4 secondary fields of study.

## Sample Field of Study List

What follows is a sample field of study list (for a simple modern game setting). This is 
to serve as an example, and is not considered part of d00 system SRD. However, it is also 
not intellectual property claimed by DwD Studios so you may choose to use it or adapt it 
for any game derived from this SRD.

* Combat: represents skills related to killing enemies and breaking things.
* Science: represents skills related to scholarly and scientific knowledge and their application.
* Technology: represents skills related to mechanics, electronics, computers, robotics, etc.
* Outdoors: represents skills related to travel, animals, survival, and navigation.
* Rogue: represents skills related to sneaking, stealing, forging, lock picking, shadowing, and other illicit activities.
* Influence: represents skills related to persuasion in any of its many forms.
* General: represents skills unrelated to the other categories but typical for common people.

The skills which each of these sample fields include will be explained in the 
skills section. In this example, since the game would consist of 7 fields of study, 
characters would have 1 primary and 2 secondary fields of study to show their 
individual professional strengths.

# Skills

Each field of study must include a like number of specific skills, each no less 
helpful to an adventurer than the last. This balances the skill list so that 
selecting which field of study is Primary and Secondary doesn't become a game 
of min-maxing for the "best character."

## Skill Level

Skills have levels ranging from 1 to 6. Starting characters will likely only 
have a couple of level 1 skills. Skill levels have the following general meanings:

* Level 1 - the character has a novice-level understanding of the skill.
* Level 2 - the character has a journeyman-level understanding of the skill.
* Level 3 - the character has a professional-level understanding of the skill.
* Level 4 - the character has an expert-level understanding of the skill.
* Level 5 - the character has an elite-level understanding of the skill.
* Level 6 - the character is considered a master of the skill.

## Skill Scores

All skills will have an ability associated with it. For instance, a Stealth 
skill (as part of, for instance, a "Criminal" field of study) might be 
associated with AGL. Some skills will be broad in nature and it might be difficult 
to specify only a single ability, but when selecting a skill set for a d00-system 
game, select the ability that would most typically be used. For instance, a Medical 
skill might encompass surgery as well as medicine, but might specify LOG as the 
associated ability because most of the time the character would be using LOG with 
his skill. Sometimes, the associated ability can be selected by the player. For 
instance, a Wrestling skill might use a character's STR or AGL, whichever is highest. 
In any case, all skills will have an associated ability.

To calculate a character's skill score, divide the associated ability by 2 and 
add 10 per skill level. If this skill falls within the character's Primary 
field of study, add +20. If it falls within a Secondary field of study, add 
+10. The final result is your character's skill score.

`Ability/2 + 10xLevel +20 if Primary, +10 if Secondary`

> For instance, a character's Acrobatics skill (as part of a "Fitness" field of 
> study?) has AGL specified. The character has an AGL score of 55. The character 
> is built with "Fitness" field of study as Secondary to his concept. The 
> character has 2 levels in that skill. His skill score is AGL/2 +20 (for skill 
> level) +10 (for secondary field of study) = 55/2+30 = 58%. The player records 
> this on the character sheet as "Acrobatics, level 2, 58%".

## Types of Skills

There are four types of skills: Standard skills, Focus skills, Discipline skills, 
and Power skills. Each is handled somewhat differently. When designing skill 
lists for a d00 system game, it is important that you consider the game system, 
not try to make the "perfect skill list" (such doesn't exist).

> For instance, if one game system (science fiction) technology might be important 
> enough to the game that you would have robotics, computers, electronics, and 
> mechanics all as separate skills under one "Technology" field of study. In another 
> game with a different focus (perhaps a horror-based science fiction game) all of 
> those might be blended together into one focus-based skill called "Tech" which 
> might fall under a "White-collar" field of study. There is no fixed rule on this, 
> and it is important to wed the skill list to the game system in a way that it 
> compliments game play.

### Standard Skill

A standard skill is likely what most skills will be. It generally specifies a single 
task (or group of related tasks) into one single score. An example might be Marksman, 
which might fall under a "Soldier" field of study. It would represent a very specific 
type of action (for example, to shoot someone or something).

### Focus Skill

A focus skill is more categorical in nature. It has a list of focuses which 
categorically fall under the one skill. When you first acquire level 1 in a focus 
skill, you must select one of the listed focuses to narrow the definition of your 
character's expertise with that skill. You will be able to use that aspect of the 
skill at your listed skill score. Any other aspect of that skill (that is, trying 
to use another focus) is at a -20 penalty. Whenever you advance a level in a focus 
skill, you do not automatically receive another focus. You may, however, pay an 
extra +1DP (development point) when purchasing the new level in order to acquire 
another focus from that skill's list.

> For example, a modern game might have a single skill called "Vehicle Operations" 
> which falls under a field of study called "Technical". It might be a focus skill 
> that includes the focuses: domestic vehicles, industrial vehicles, military 
> vehicles, water vehicles, airplanes, jets, and helicopters. When your character 
> purchases level 1 in Vehicle Operations, you might select "domestic vehicles" as 
> your focus. Whenever you make a vehicle operations skill check to operate domestic 
> vehicles, you roll against your normal skill score. If suddenly trying to operate 
> a tank (a "military vehicle") you'd use your normal skill score -20. Later, when 
> purchasing level 2 in the vehicle operations skill, you may spend an extra +1DP 
> to also gain the focus "military vehicles" to no longer have -20 to operate 
> military vehicles (now you can drive domestic and military vehicles with identical 
> skill).

When purchasing level 6 (the highest skill level), you can opt to spend +1DP and 
instead of gaining a new focus, you can instead state that your character is 
now a leading expert in the game world(s). This makes you eagerly sought after 
for performing actions of that type, a living legend for those who strive for 
such mastery.

### Discipline Skill

A discipline skill provides access to specific discrete abilities that all fall 
within the scope of a related skill. Similar in some ways to focus skills, but 
the abilities gained by each discipline are specific. Every level you attain 
(including first level) allows you to select another discipline (at no additional 
development point cost). Every discipline is a specific action you can take, an 
ability you can perform. Some disciplines might require skill checks, others 
just might give bonuses under specific circumstances.

> For example, a game might have a "martial arts" skill which falls under a 
> "combatant" field of study. It might be a discipline skill which includes the 
> disciplines: kick, punch, elbow, knee, roll-with-the-punch, hammerfist, spinning 
> kick, instant stand, and all-around-sight. Each of these disciplines would have 
> a specific described effect. The "spinning kick" discipline might be described 
> as "your character spins around for momentum and will cause double damage if he 
> hits. However, if a successful spinning kick is defended against successfully 
> by a dodge (see resistance checks) then your character is knocked on the ground 
> prone and must spend a turn getting back up, unless he also has the 'instant 
> stand' discipline."

### Power Skill

A power skill provides access to scalable abilities that relate to one skill, but 
a character has finite personal resources to fuel these abilities. Normally used 
only with mystical, supernatural, or magical powers. Individual game systems 
derived from the d00 System SRD may have their own subsystems for handling these 
special powers.

# Character Development

Character development in d00 System is simple. Development Points are awarded 
after each session, then spent before the beginning of the next, and represent 
individual growth and training. Unspent DP are accumulated and may be spent 
between sessions later.

## Development Points

Characters will earn Development Points (sometimes called "DP") for their efforts. 
These development points are earned at the end of a game session and are spent 
before the next (unless the GM determines some level of training is necessary).

## Earning Development Points

At the end of a game session, the GM goes through the following checklist with 
each player. One Development Point is awarded for each of these that apply. 
This will typically result in receiving 3-7 development points per session, 
with no more than 10DP being awarded.

* **Survival â€“** All characters will earn this one. A character will receive 
one DP just for surviving the session. Even if he learned nothing, and did 
nothing. Just being around greatness can rub off.
* **Ability â€“** if a character made an ability check during the session, the 
player will be awarded one DP. This is to represent physical and mental 
development. Of course, the player doesnâ€™t have to spend that DP on that ability.
* **Skill â€“** Players get an additional DP if they made a skill check at some 
point during the session. It doesnâ€™t matter if that skill check resulted in 
success or failure. Testing knowledge and training will result in excellence.
* **Discovery â€“** Characters earn one DP if the player can say one previously 
unknown thing that his character learned about the setting or its people. 
Players can be creative here, but the purpose of this award is twofold: 
first, it allows a character to grow based on knowledge as well as practice. 
Second, it helps a player summarize in his mind something about the game 
setting, helping him to gain a better picture of it in his mind.
* **Role-playing â€“** Players are awarded one DP if they role-played their character 
well. This is determined by the GM. The more solid a character concept and background 
story, the more likely a player should get this award. This award shouldnâ€™t be given 
out lightly; rather, it should be given if a character loses out on something or 
takes on additional complexities just to stay in character, when violating a 
character concept would have been easier and/or more beneficial.
* **Innovation â€“** If the player's character faced non-combat obstacles (such as 
security devices, pits, puzzles, etc.) that required creativity in overcoming, 
the player should receive get an additional DP. This shouldnâ€™t be given freely 
just because some obstacle existed; it should be given to reward characters for 
coming up with an innovative solution to an obstacle.
* **Notoriety â€“** legends are made by people telling tales, not by the deeds 
themselves. People tend to try to live up to the tales told about them, and it 
is sometimes the carrot that leads a donkey to greatness. If a character saved 
innocent people, overcame obstacles in a manner that onlookers will remember, or 
allowed enemies to live on to spread the tales of his toughness, your character 
will be awarded one DP. It doesnâ€™t matter if the notoriety he gained is in the 
form of fame or infamy (all press is good press?)
* **Personal â€“** if a character had a personal stake in the adventure (it centered 
around family members, friends, contacts, etc.) then the character will gain an 
extra DP. This shouldnâ€™t be given out freely; this award is to represent those rare 
adventure sessions where players find themselves extremely wrapped up in the story 
because of how it directly affects the development of his or her characterâ€™s concept.
* **Victory â€“** Any character who engaged in combat of any type against enemy 
creatures, robots, or people and lived to tell the tale are awarded one DP.
* **Success â€“** If this session had a main mission or story goal (determined by the 
GM) and the characters were successful, each receives one DP. Success of a mission 
isnâ€™t any more heavily weighted than using skills or abilities or surviving the 
session.

## Spending Development Points

Development Points can be accumulated and spent to increase ability scores and skill 
levels. These rules are core to games derived from d00 System SRD, though customization 
may exist from game to game to fit a desired genre.

### Ability Score Development

Each development point spent on an ability increases that ability by a certain amount, 
depending on its current value. This is determined using the table below:

| Current Score | Development Point Cost               |
|:---:|:---|
| Up to 25 | 1DP raises the ability score by +4 |
| 26 to 45 | 1DP raises the ability score by +2 |
| 46 to 55 | 1DP raises the ability score by +1 |
| 56 to 75 | 2DP raises the ability score by +1 |
| 76 to 100 | 3DP raises the ability score by +1 |
| 101 to 125 | 5DP raises the ability score by +1 |
| each +25 | +2DP to raise the ability score by +1 |

### Skill Level Development

You may also choose to spend your development points improving your skill levels. 
The cost of developing skill levels can be found in the following table:

| Skill Level | Development Point Cost |
|:---:|:---|
| Level 1 | 3 DP |
| Level 2 | 6 DP |
| Level 3 | 9 DP |
| Level 4 | 12 DP |
| Level 5 | 15 DP |
| Level 6 | 18 DP |

You may not skip levels. If you are unskilled and wish to gain skill levels, you 
must purchase level 1. If your skill is already rated at level 1 and you wish to 
improve it, you purchase level 2 (even if you have enough development points saved 
up to raise it to level 3). Although you cannot skip levels, you can increase multiple 
skills a single level each. In this way your character grows to legendary ability.

**Skill development maximum â€“** No skill may be increased beyond level 6. A skill 
may not be improved twice after the same game session, though more than one skill 
could be improved.

**Focus skills â€“** some skills are noted as focus skills. The first level of a focus 
skill automatically allows the character to have one area of focus. Each additional 
level, the character may â€“ if the player wishes â€“ purchase another area of focus by 
paying one extra development point. Any actions involving an area of focus use the 
full skill success rate. Any action involving uses of the skill outside the characterâ€™s 
area of focus applies a -20 penalty.

**Discipline skills â€“** some skills are noted as discipline skills. At first level 
and each level thereafter, a character automatically receives one discipline from that 
skillâ€™s list. There is no development point cost for this discipline.
