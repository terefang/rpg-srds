# d00 System SRD

rescued from https://web.archive.org/web/20120622021304/http://d00system.com/index.php?title=Main_Page

This is the basic system reference document for the d00 System SRD. This is a core rules set for role-playing games based on a simple system using only ten-sided dice. Anyone can publish works derived from this system reference document, using the well-tested rules presented here, free of charge. It is only necessary that you credit DwD Studios and include the creative commons license found at the end of the links contained in the table of contents provided below.

# The Basics

## Game Master

Within the scope of this SRD, the generic term "GM" will be used. You can use this term or you may substitute a term that is more specific to your game or setting, such as Referee, Narrator, etc. The GM's role is similar to game masters in many other game systems (role-playing non-player characters, setting up the scenes, narration, storytelling, judging attempted activities of the players, mediating combat, assessing modifiers to rolls, etc.) Note that there is one special rule regarding GMs in games made with the d00 System SRD: passive ability and skill checks (see below).

## Terms

For clarification purposes, the following terms are true:

* The terms "check" and "roll" are often used interchangeably and always refer to rolling d00 and trying to roll less than or equal to some listed ability or skill score.
* Any check/roll made by the player against an ability or skill score constitutes an "action" and is therefore affected by any rule which refers to an action. Rolls made passively by the GM without the player's knowledge (even if using scores on the player's character sheet) do not count as an action. Some other types of rolls which do not count as an action: initiative, damage.

## Dice Notation

The d00 system uses 10-sided dice for all resolution mechanics. Since only 10-sided dice are used, standard gaming conventions of 1d10, 2d10, etc. can optionally be replaced by a capital "D", as in 1D, 2D, etc. This should be standardized in the product derived from this work (either all uses follow one convention or all uses follow the other). Therefore the following die notations are acceptable:

**Die codes and their meanings**

* #d5 or #D/2   \
  Roll a number ("#") of ten-sided dice and divide the result in half, rounding up. Produces a result from 1-5.
* #d10 or #D    \
  Roll a number ("#") of ten-sided dice and sum them up. 3d10 (or 3D) for instance, results in a number from 3-30.
* d00 or D00
    * Roll two ten-sided dice. The first die is read as the tens digit while the second die is read as the ones digit.
    * Results are read as a percent. For instance, a roll of 0 followed by 7 is 7%. A roll of 5 followed by 2 is 52%.
    * Special Note: in some game systems, percent rolls like this treat a roll of 00 as 100%. In this system, 00 is 0%.

Die rolls are expressed in the format:

`[#] die type [+/- modifiers]`

> Example: 3d10+2 means: "Roll 3 ten sided dice. Add the result of the three dice together. Add 2."

## Rounding Fractions

In general, if you wind up with a fraction while calculating anything related to character creation or game play, round in the favor of your character.

## Basic Task Resolution
There are two basic ways a character will resolve tasks: ability checks and skill checks. These are used to accomplish actions and/or to resist effects.

### Ability checks

To make an ability check, roll d00 and you must roll less than or equal to your ability score (explained in the abilities section).

### Skill checks

To make a skill check, roll d00 and you must roll less than or equal to your skill score (which is explained in the skills section). See the skills section for more information, and for details on attempting skills without necessary skill levels.

### Resistance Checks

A resistance check is a special kind of ability or skill check. Resistance checks are designed to allow a character a chance to shrug off certain baneful effects. They are handled like any other ability or skill check, and are special to each circumstance. A resistance check does count as an action, and players bombarding an enemy with actions which require resistance checks is one way to whittle down a strong foe's attention and keep him from killing the party.

For instance, a grenade might be listed as causing a certain amount of damage, "half damage with a successful AGL check." That is an AGL-based resistance roll. As another example, a mystical effect might specify that the target of the effect becomes dazed and confused, unable to act "unless they succeed in a WIL check." In these cases, even if the term "resistance check" isn't specified, the roll is treated as one. When a character performs a resistance roll, the GM and player may explain how the resistance check appears. For instance, in the grenade example above the GM might specify that the player dives prone behind a nearby rock. In the mystical effect, the GM or player might say that the character screams through gritted teeth "GET OUT OF MY HEAD" while he whacks at the creature responsible for the mental assault.

**Dodging in Combat -** One very typical type of resistance check is dodging in combat. This is often called a "dodge" within the rules, but is in fact just one common example of a resistance check. When an opponent scores a hit on a target, the target may opt to perform a resistance check in the form of a dodge. This is done with an AGL check, success meaning the target has avoided the attack. Of course, dodging multiple attackers is progressively difficult (as is dodging and attacking in the same turn) because of the multi-action penalty, but that's what makes experienced agile characters truly elite.

**Disadvantage -** Sometimes a resistance check will be specially penalized by a significant disadvantage (that is, some types of effects are more difficult to resist in certain ways than others). This is known as being at a "disadvantage". For instance, a character trying to dodge a bullet is at a disadvantage over dodging a thrust from a spear; both can be deadly but the bullet is by far more difficult to see, anticipate, time, and avoid. In such a case a resistance roll will use one half the appropriate ability as the base chance to resist.

Being at a resistance disadvantage is common in combat under these circumstances: if the defender is unarmed but is trying to dodge a melee attack from an armed attacker; or if the defender is trying to dodge a shot from an aimed firearm. Note that there are exceptions to this rule: a burst from an automatic weapon is different than an aimed shot and therefore might have its own rules.

### Passive Ability and Skill Checks

If the GM wants to know if a player's character notices or knows something, he may make an ability or skill check (see below) and describe the results of that check to the players. This happens without any effort by the player, and therefore doesn't count as an action. The GM does not simply say "Give me a Knowledge: Occult check" or "Make a perception roll". Having the GM perform these types of passive rolls removes any ambiguity over what constitutes an action.

### Modifiers

The GM can assign any bonuses or penalties the situation warrants. Specific modifiers may be given in rules. A modifier is applied to the ability score or skill score before dice are rolled. For example, a STR of 65 with a modifier of -20 means the ability check has a 45% chance to succeed.

**Categorized success modifiers:** For ad-hoc modifier application, GMs may assess the situation and apply one of the following categorized success modifiers.

|--:|:--|
| Easy:         | +20 modifier |
| Normal:       | no modifier |
| Challenging:  | -10 modifier |
| Hard:         | -20 modifier |
| Very Hard:    | -30 modifier |
| Improbable:   | -40 modifier |
| Yeah, right:  | -50 modifier |

## Additional Considerations

The following represents additional rules that are part of the d00 System and should be employed by products derived from this SRD.

### Automatic success/failure

Regardless of the calculated chance of success, any reasonable action check succeeds on any roll of 00-05. Similarly, any action with a reasonable risk of failure will do so on any roll 95-99.

### Critical success/failure

Any time you roll doubles (00, 11, 22, 33, etc.) and succeed in your roll, you have succeeded critically. A critical success means something beneficial occurred, decided by the GM or by specified rules. Any time you roll doubles (77, 88, 99, etc.) and fail, you have failed critically. A critical failure means something baneful occurred, decided by the GM or by specified rules.

### Contests

When two people are pitting their talents and/or training against one another, this is called an action contest. Action contests work just like normal task resolution. The GM determines which ability or skill is appropriate (might be same or different for each contestant). Both parties make a roll. If one succeeds and the other fails, the victor is obvious. Otherwise, play continues until there is a clear victor.

### Cooperation

When multiple people coordinate their efforts, the person with the highest chance of success is referred to as the acting character. Anyone helping is referred to as a helper only if his calculated chance of success is within 20 of the acting character’s chance of success. The acting character's player rolls for success, with a bonus of +10 to his roll for each helper. The GM may decide that there is a limit to how much help one person can receive based on the situation.

### Multi-Actions

Any roll/check made by the player against an ability or skill is called an action. The first action you attempt in a turn uses whatever chance of success exists for that action (no penalty). Your second action is at a -20. Your third action is at a -40, your third at -60, etc. You can therefore attempt as many actions as you wish until the penalty is too steep for you to attempt anything further. The actions are considered to be simultaneous or in direct sequence, so players can't just come back at the end of a turn and announce they want their character to try five or six other things hoping to just roll luckily. Note that resistance checks do count as actions and do carry a multi-action penalty.

### Extended Actions

An extended action will require a number of successes in order to succeed. For instance, lock-picking a security lock might require a 2-point extended action. Another (more complex) security lock might require a 3-point extended action, etc.

Each turn, the character is permitted to make a check (the GM will decide which type of check it is). If he succeeds, he gets a point. If he fails, he loses a point (if he has any to lose). Once he's accumulated enough points to fulfill the needs of the extended action, he's finally succeeded in that action. Of course, if his chance to succeed is quite low, he player will likely give up trying before succeeding in a long extended action.

Note that the character can skip a turn if he has to accomplish something unrelated, then continue where he left off. For instance, a character working a few turns on a 3-point extended lock pick might have to stop his efforts for one turn while he shoots at some goons. That turn he neither gains or loses a point. Next turn he can continue as normal. However, some actions might reset themselves with an interruption. The GM should inform the player of such a situation before they decide they wish to interrupt their activities.

Extended actions only apply in combat; when outside of a combat situation, any task is resolved with a single roll of the dice – even extended actions.

# Abilities

All characters have scores in the following eight abilities (sometimes called characteristics or ability scores):

## Abilities

The following is the standard core ability set for games using the d00 System SRD.

### Strength

This ability represents raw power and muscle, developed or natural. A character with a high score can punch harder or lift greater weights than his weakling friends. Characters with high strength tend to look the part, having well-developed physiques that do not go unnoticed. Strength is a physical ability and is abbreviated STR.

### Endurance

This ability represents stamina and energy. A character with a high score can recover from exhaustion quicker, resist toxins better, or endure pain longer than his wimpy friends. Endurance also represents resistance to damage before the body shuts down from trauma (that is, it is used to determine Body Points). Endurance is a physical ability and is abbreviated END.

### Dexterity

This ability represents general hand-eye coordination. A character with a high score can aim better or pick a pocket defter than his clumsy friends. Although very beneficial in combat, dexterity is no more important to a warrior than the other physical abilities. Dexterity is a physical ability and is abbreviated DEX.

### Agility

This ability represents quickness of the body, its balance, grace, flexibility and maneuverability. It is the celerity with which that messages from the brain are acted upon, and the general fluidity of motion of the body’s muscles. Characters with high scores in agility tend to be the fastest runners, best dodgers, and the first one to act in a tense situation. Agility is a physical ability and is abbreviated AGL.

### Perception

This ability represents the five senses, in addition to raw intuition. A character with a high score can sense the presence of an enemy in a concealed location, guess the whereabouts of a proverbial needle in a haystack, or sense the weak spot in an enemy's defenses. Characters with high ratings in perception tend not to be surprised in ambush situations and are often sent ahead of a group to scout for his dull-witted friends. Perception is a mental ability and is abbreviated PER.

### Logic

This ability represents knowledge and the powers of deductive reasoning. Characters with high scores in logic tend to learn faster, remember better, break complex ciphers faster, and program computers more effectively than their stupid friends. Logic is a mental ability and is abbreviated LOG.

### Charisma

This ability represents the character's personality, charm, wit, and fellowship. Characters with high scores in charisma tend to make friends easier, persuade more effectively, and get along well with others more effortlessly than their jerk friends. Charisma is a mental ability and is abbreviated CHA

### Willpower

This ability represents the strength of a character's personality, his presence, leadership, and ability through direct or indirect intentions to inspire others to act, either out of respect, fear, or some combination of the two. Characters with high scores in willpower tend to rise in military ranks faster, interrogate more effectively, endure mental duress better, and attract followers more easily than their weak-willed friends. Willpower is a mental ability and is abbreviated WIL.

## Lite Ability Set

In some game genres, a smaller/simpler ability set may be desired. If this is desired, the following "lite" ability set can be used:

| Ability | Abbr. | Description |
|:--|:---:|:---|
| Strength   | STR  | treat this as a combination of STR and END from above. |
| Dexterity  | DEX  | treat this as a combination of DEX and AGL from above. |
| Logic      | LOG  | treat this as a combination of PER and LOG from above. |
| Willpower  | WIL  | treat this as a combination of CHA and WIL from above. |

## Scores

Scores are rated as a percent. Each score generally ranges from 35% - 75% for starting characters in a game which simulates any level of reality. Scores above 100 are possible.

### Starting Ability Scores

Individual games created using this d00 System SRD can have their own ability score generation methods. As an example, the following can be used.

Roll d00 on the random ability score table once for each of the eight abilities, then arrange them as desired to help meet an envisioned character concept:

| d00 | Score | Comments |
|:--|:---:|:---|
|00-09 | 35% | Feeble |
|10-19 | 40% | Low |
|20-34 | 45% | Below Average |
|35-54 | 50% | Typical |
|55-69 | 55% | Above Average |
|70-79 | 60% | High |
|80-89 | 65% | Good |
|90-94 | 70% | Excellent |
|95-99 | 75% | Remarkable |

## Derived Abilities

In addition to the primary abilities (or the lite ability set) defined above, characters in games created from the d00 System SRD have a few other abilities which are derived from those described above. These are called derived abilities.

### Body Points

Body Points (abbreviated BP) is simply the number of points of damage your character can sustain before he falls unconscious (or worse!). Body Points are calculated by using half the character's END score (if using the lite ability set, half the STR score). When a character reaches 0 BP, he is unconscious. When the action is over, the character must make an END check to awaken with 1 BP. If the check is failed, the character is dead.

For instance, a character with an END score of 55 has 28 BP.

### Initiative

Most characters have an initiative score of 1. This is the number of dice rolled to determine who goes first in combat. Very perceptive characters (PER 65% or higher) or very quick characters (AGL 65% or higher) have an initiative score of 2. A character who is both very quick and very perceptive (both scores 65% or higher) has a 3 initiative score and is extraordinarily fast. Initiative is explained more in the combat section.

Note that if using the lite ability set, LOG and AGL are used to determine Initiative.

### Movement

Time and distance can vary among games created using the d00 System SRD. One game might use meters per turn, another might use feet per second, etc. Still others might use an abstract unit of "spaces" per turn, designed for miniature use. Because of this, individual games will have totally different measurements of time and distance for movement considerations. What follows is a well-tested default movement resolution system that can serve as a default for any game derived from this SRD.

Characters have movement rates listed in three values: normal, fast, and hourly. A character who is moving normally is walking. Characters may move this walking distance in a combat turn for free. A player who wants his character to move faster must make an AGL check. If he succeeds, he may move up to his fast movement rate, but if he fails, he moves only twice his normal rate.

> For instance, a character might have a movement rate of 10m/turn, 30m/turn, 5kph. He may move up to 10 meters for free. If the player wants to move further, he makes an AGL check. If he succeeds, he'll move 30 meters. If he fails, he'll move only 20 meters (twice his normal rate).

The character's hourly rate is for exploring on larger scale maps. It assumes a cautious pace. If a player wishes his character to increase his rate, he may make an END check. If he succeeds, he can double his hourly rate. If he fails, he moves his normal hourly rate.

### Melee Damage Modifier

When using melee weapons or bare hands, characters who are very strong will hurt their enemies more than characters who are very weak. Therefore, melee damage is modified by a character's Strength score according to the following table.

|Strength | Melee Damage Modifier |
|:--|:---:|
| 01-05	 | -5 |
| 06-15	 | -4 |
| 16-25	 | -3 |
| 26-35	 | -2 |
| 36-45	 | -1 |
| 46-55	 | +0 |
| 56-65	 | +1 |
| 66-75	 | +2 |
| 76-85	 | +3 |
| 86-95	 | +4 |
| 96-105 | 	+5 |
| Each +10 | 	+1 |

### Ranged Damage Modifier

When using ranged weapons such as bows or firearms, characters who are very dextrous will hurt their enemies more than characters who are very uncoordinated, by hitting them more effectively. Therefore, ranged damage is modified by a character's Dexterity score according to the following table.

| Dexterity | Ranged Damage Modifier |
|:--|:---:|
| 01-05	 | -5 |
| 06-15	 | -4 |
| 16-25	 | -3 |
| 26-35	 | -2 |
| 36-45	 | -1 |
| 46-55	 | +0 |
| 56-65	 | +1 |
| 66-75	 | +2 |
| 76-85	 | +3 |
| 86-95	 | +4 |
| 96-105 | 	+5 |
| Each +10 | 	+1 |

# Fields of Study

Any d00 game system has several fields of study. A field of study is a category of talent and training. Most games should have at least 4, and no upper limit exists. A field of study (sometimes abbreviated "FoS") organizes the skill list for the game. Within each field of study will be a list of skills (which are also broad in scope, see the skills section).

There is no specified list that is core to d00 system SRD. The only fact which is "core" is that there must exist at least 4 fields of study.

## Primary and Secondary Fields of Study

Each character will have one field of study which is primary to his player's character concept. When calculating the skill score of any/all skills within a character's primary field of study, a bonus of +20 is applied.

Depending on the number of fields of study used in the game/setting, the character may also have one or more fields of study which are secondary to his player's character concept. Skill scores for skills under a secondary field of study receive a bonus of +10. The number of secondary fields of study a character is given can be determined from the following guidelines:

* In a game with 4 fields of study — characters have no secondary fields of study.
* In a game with 5-6 fields of study — characters have 1 secondary field of study.
* In a game with 7-8 fields of study — characters have 2 secondary fields of study.
* In a game with 9-12 fields of study — characters have 3 secondary fields of study.
* In a game with 13-16 fields of study — characters have 4 secondary fields of study.

## Sample Field of Study List

What follows is a sample field of study list (for a simple modern game setting). This is to serve as an example, and is not considered part of d00 system SRD. However, it is also not intellectual property claimed by DwD Studios so you may choose to use it or adapt it for any game derived from this SRD.

* Combat: represents skills related to killing enemies and breaking things.
* Science: represents skills related to scholarly and scientific knowledge and their application.
* Technology: represents skills related to mechanics, electronics, computers, robotics, etc.
* Outdoors: represents skills related to travel, animals, survival, and navigation.
* Rogue: represents skills related to sneaking, stealing, forging, lock picking, shadowing, and other illicit activities.
* Influence: represents skills related to persuasion in any of its many forms.
* General: represents skills unrelated to the other categories but typical for common people.

The skills which each of these sample fields include will be explained in the skills section. In this example, since the game would consist of 7 fields of study, characters would have 1 primary and 2 secondary fields of study to show their individual professional strengths.


# Skills

Each field of study must include a like number of specific skills, each no less helpful to an adventurer than the last. This balances the skill list so that selecting which field of study is Primary and Secondary doesn't become a game of min-maxing for the "best character."

## Skill Level

Skills have levels ranging from 1 to 6. Starting characters will likely only have a couple of level 1 skills. Skill levels have the following general meanings:

* Level 1 - the character has a novice-level understanding of the skill.
* Level 2 - the character has a journeyman-level understanding of the skill.
* Level 3 - the character has a professional-level understanding of the skill.
* Level 4 - the character has an expert-level understanding of the skill.
* Level 5 - the character has an elite-level understanding of the skill.
* Level 6 - the character is considered a master of the skill.

## Skill Scores

All skills will have an ability associated with it. For instance, a Stealth skill (as part of, for instance, a "Criminal" field of study) might be associated with AGL. Some skills will be broad in nature and it might be difficult to specify only a single ability, but when selecting a skill set for a d00-system game, select the ability that would most typically be used. For instance, a Medical skill might encompass surgery as well as medicine, but might specify LOG as the associated ability because most of the time the character would be using LOG with his skill. Sometimes, the associated ability can be selected by the player. For instance, a Wrestling skill might use a character's STR or AGL, whichever is highest. In any case, all skills will have an associated ability.

To calculate a character's skill score, divide the associated ability by 2 and add 10 per skill level. If this skill falls within the character's Primary field of study, add +20. If it falls within a Secondary field of study, add +10. The final result is your character's skill score.

`Ability/2 + 10xLevel +20 if Primary, +10 if Secondary`

> For instance, a character's Acrobatics skill (as part of a "Fitness" field of study?) has AGL specified. The character has an AGL score of 55. The character is built with "Fitness" field of study as Secondary to his concept. The character has 2 levels in that skill. His skill score is AGL/2 +20 (for skill level) +10 (for secondary field of study) = 55/2+30 = 58%. The player records this on the character sheet as "Acrobatics, level 2, 58%".

## Types of Skills

There are four types of skills: Standard skills, Focus skills, Discipline skills, and Power skills. Each is handled somewhat differently. When designing skill lists for a d00 system game, it is important that you consider the game system, not try to make the "perfect skill list" (such doesn't exist).

> For instance, if one game system (science fiction) technology might be important enough to the game that you would have robotics, computers, electronics, and mechanics all as separate skills under one "Technology" field of study. In another game with a different focus (perhaps a horror-based science fiction game) all of those might be blended together into one focus-based skill called "Tech" which might fall under a "White-collar" field of study. There is no fixed rule on this, and it is important to wed the skill list to the game system in a way that it compliments game play.

### Standard Skill

A standard skill is likely what most skills will be. It generally specifies a single task (or group of related tasks) into one single score. An example might be Marksman, which might fall under a "Soldier" field of study. It would represent a very specific type of action (for example, to shoot someone or something).

### Focus Skill

A focus skill is more categorical in nature. It has a list of focuses which categorically fall under the one skill. When you first acquire level 1 in a focus skill, you must select one of the listed focuses to narrow the definition of your character's expertise with that skill. You will be able to use that aspect of the skill at your listed skill score. Any other aspect of that skill (that is, trying to use another focus) is at a -20 penalty. Whenever you advance a level in a focus skill, you do not automatically receive another focus. You may, however, pay an extra +1DP (development point) when purchasing the new level in order to acquire another focus from that skill's list.

> For example, a modern game might have a single skill called "Vehicle Operations" which falls under a field of study called "Technical". It might be a focus skill that includes the focuses: domestic vehicles, industrial vehicles, military vehicles, water vehicles, airplanes, jets, and helicopters. When your character purchases level 1 in Vehicle Operations, you might select "domestic vehicles" as your focus. Whenever you make a vehicle operations skill check to operate domestic vehicles, you roll against your normal skill score. If suddenly trying to operate a tank (a "military vehicle") you'd use your normal skill score -20. Later, when purchasing level 2 in the vehicle operations skill, you may spend an extra +1DP to also gain the focus "military vehicles" to no longer have -20 to operate military vehicles (now you can drive domestic and military vehicles with identical skill).

When purchasing level 6 (the highest skill level), you can opt to spend +1DP and instead of gaining a new focus, you can instead state that your character is now a leading expert in the game world(s). This makes you eagerly sought after for performing actions of that type, a living legend for those who strive for such mastery.

### Discipline Skill

A discipline skill provides access to specific discrete abilities that all fall within the scope of a related skill. Similar in some ways to focus skills, but the abilities gained by each discipline are specific. Every level you attain (including first level) allows you to select another discipline (at no additional development point cost). Every discipline is a specific action you can take, an ability you can perform. Some disciplines might require skill checks, others just might give bonuses under specific circumstances.

> For example, a game might have a "martial arts" skill which falls under a "combatant" field of study. It might be a discipline skill which includes the disciplines: kick, punch, elbow, knee, roll-with-the-punch, hammerfist, spinning kick, instant stand, and all-around-sight. Each of these disciplines would have a specific described effect. The "spinning kick" discipline might be described as "your character spins around for momentum and will cause double damage if he hits. However, if a successful spinning kick is defended against successfully by a dodge (see resistance checks) then your character is knocked on the ground prone and must spend a turn getting back up, unless he also has the 'instant stand' discipline."

###Power Skill

A power skill provides access to scalable abilities that relate to one skill, but a character has finite personal resources to fuel these abilities. Normally used only with mystical, supernatural, or magical powers. Individual game systems derived from the d00 System SRD may have their own subsystems for handling these special powers.


# Character Development

Character development in d00 System is simple. Development Points are awarded after each session, then spent before the beginning of the next, and represent individual growth and training. Unspent DP are accumulated and may be spent between sessions later.

## Development Points

Characters will earn Development Points (sometimes called "DP") for their efforts. These development points are earned at the end of a game session and are spent before the next (unless the GM determines some level of training is necessary).

## Earning Development Points

At the end of a game session, the GM goes through the following checklist with each player. One Development Point is awarded for each of these that apply. This will typically result in receiving 3-7 development points per session, with no more than 10DP being awarded.

* **Survival –** All characters will earn this one. A character will receive one DP just for surviving the session. Even if he learned nothing, and did nothing. Just being around greatness can rub off.
* **Ability –** if a character made an ability check during the session, the player will be awarded one DP. This is to represent physical and mental development. Of course, the player doesn’t have to spend that DP on that ability.
* **Skill –** Players get an additional DP if they made a skill check at some point during the session. It doesn’t matter if that skill check resulted in success or failure. Testing knowledge and training will result in excellence.
* **Discovery –** Characters earn one DP if the player can say one previously unknown thing that his character learned about the setting or its people. Players can be creative here, but the purpose of this award is twofold: first, it allows a character to grow based on knowledge as well as practice. Second, it helps a player summarize in his mind something about the game setting, helping him to gain a better picture of it in his mind.
* **Role-playing –** Players are awarded one DP if they role-played their character well. This is determined by the GM. The more solid a character concept and background story, the more likely a player should get this award. This award shouldn’t be given out lightly; rather, it should be given if a character loses out on something or takes on additional complexities just to stay in character, when violating a character concept would have been easier and/or more beneficial.
* **Innovation –** If the player's character faced non-combat obstacles (such as security devices, pits, puzzles, etc.) that required creativity in overcoming, the player should receive get an additional DP. This shouldn’t be given freely just because some obstacle existed; it should be given to reward characters for coming up with an innovative solution to an obstacle.
* **Notoriety –** legends are made by people telling tales, not by the deeds themselves. People tend to try to live up to the tales told about them, and it is sometimes the carrot that leads a donkey to greatness. If a character saved innocent people, overcame obstacles in a manner that onlookers will remember, or allowed enemies to live on to spread the tales of his toughness, your character will be awarded one DP. It doesn’t matter if the notoriety he gained is in the form of fame or infamy (all press is good press?)
* **Personal –** if a character had a personal stake in the adventure (it centered around family members, friends, contacts, etc.) then the character will gain an extra DP. This shouldn’t be given out freely; this award is to represent those rare adventure sessions where players find themselves extremely wrapped up in the story because of how it directly affects the development of his or her character’s concept.
* **Victory –** Any character who engaged in combat of any type against enemy creatures, robots, or people and lived to tell the tale are awarded one DP.
* **Success –** If this session had a main mission or story goal (determined by the GM) and the characters were successful, each receives one DP. Success of a mission isn’t any more heavily weighted than using skills or abilities or surviving the session.

## Spending Development Points

Development Points can be accumulated and spent to increase ability scores and skill levels. These rules are core to games derived from d00 System SRD, though customization may exist from game to game to fit a desired genre.

### Ability Score Development

Each development point spent on an ability increases that ability by a certain amount, depending on its current value. This is determined using the table below:

| Current Score | Development Point Cost               |
|:---:|:---|
| Up to 25 | 1DP raises the ability score by +4 |
| 26 to 45 | 1DP raises the ability score by +2 |
| 46 to 55 | 1DP raises the ability score by +1 |
| 56 to 75 | 2DP raises the ability score by +1 |
| 76 to 100 | 3DP raises the ability score by +1 |
| 101 to 125 | 5DP raises the ability score by +1 |
| each +25 | +2DP to raise the ability score by +1 |

### Skill Level Development

You may also choose to spend your development points improving your skill levels. The cost of developing skill levels can be found in the following table:

| Skill Level | Development Point Cost |
|:---:|:---|
| Level 1 | 3 DP |
| Level 2 | 6 DP |
| Level 3 | 9 DP |
| Level 4 | 12 DP |
| Level 5 | 15 DP |
| Level 6 | 18 DP |

You may not skip levels. If you are unskilled and wish to gain skill levels, you must purchase level 1. If your skill is already rated at level 1 and you wish to improve it, you purchase level 2 (even if you have enough development points saved up to raise it to level 3). Although you cannot skip levels, you can increase multiple skills a single level each. In this way your character grows to legendary ability.

**Skill development maximum –** No skill may be increased beyond level 6. A skill may not be improved twice after the same game session, though more than one skill could be improved.

**Focus skills –** some skills are noted as focus skills. The first level of a focus skill automatically allows the character to have one area of focus. Each additional level, the character may – if the player wishes – purchase another area of focus by paying one extra development point. Any actions involving an area of focus use the full skill success rate. Any action involving uses of the skill outside the character’s area of focus applies a -20 penalty.

**Discipline skills –** some skills are noted as discipline skills. At first level and each level thereafter, a character automatically receives one discipline from that skill’s list. There is no development point cost for this discipline.

c. __Copyright and Similar Rights__ means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.

d. __Effective Technological Measures__ means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.

### Section 2 – Scope.

a. ___License grant.___

1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

   A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and

   B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

2. __Exceptions and Limitations.__ For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.

4. __Media and formats; technical modifications allowed.__ The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.

5. __Downstream recipients.__

   A. __Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material.__ Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.

   B. __No downstream restrictions.__ You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.

6. __No endorsement.__ Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

b. ___Other rights.___

1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.

2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.

3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.

### Section 3 – License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.

4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.

### Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;

b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and

c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.

### Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

a. __Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.__

b. __To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.__

c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

### Section 6 – Term and Termination.

a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.

b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:

1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or

2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.

c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.

d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.

### Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.

a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.

### Section 8 – Interpretation.

a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.

b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.

c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
