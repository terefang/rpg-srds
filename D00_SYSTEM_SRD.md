This is the basic system reference document for the d00 System SRD. This is a core rules set for role-playing games based on a simple system using only ten-sided dice. Anyone can publish works derived from this system reference document, using the well-tested rules presented here, free of charge. It is only necessary that you credit DwD Studios and include the creative commons license found at the end of the links contained in the table of contents provided below.

# The Basics

## Game Master

Within the scope of this SRD, the generic term "GM" will be used. You can use this term or you may substitute a term that is more specific to your game or setting, such as Referee, Narrator, etc. The GM's role is similar to game masters in many other game systems (role-playing non-player characters, setting up the scenes, narration, storytelling, judging attempted activities of the players, mediating combat, assessing modifiers to rolls, etc.) Note that there is one special rule regarding GMs in games made with the d00 System SRD: passive ability and skill checks (see below).

## Terms

For clarification purposes, the following terms are true:

* The terms "check" and "roll" are often used interchangeably and always refer to rolling d00 and trying to roll less than or equal to some listed ability or skill score.
* Any check/roll made by the player against an ability or skill score constitutes an "action" and is therefore affected by any rule which refers to an action. Rolls made passively by the GM without the player's knowledge (even if using scores on the player's character sheet) do not count as an action. Some other types of rolls which do not count as an action: initiative, damage.

## Dice Notation

The d00 system uses 10-sided dice for all resolution mechanics. Since only 10-sided dice are used, standard gaming conventions of 1d10, 2d10, etc. can optionally be replaced by a capital "D", as in 1D, 2D, etc. This should be standardized in the product derived from this work (either all uses follow one convention or all uses follow the other). Therefore the following die notations are acceptable:

**Die codes and their meanings**

* #d5 or #D/2   \
  Roll a number ("#") of ten-sided dice and divide the result in half, rounding up. Produces a result from 1-5.
* #d10 or #D    \
  Roll a number ("#") of ten-sided dice and sum them up. 3d10 (or 3D) for instance, results in a number from 3-30.
* d00 or D00
    * Roll two ten-sided dice. The first die is read as the tens digit while the second die is read as the ones digit.
    * Results are read as a percent. For instance, a roll of 0 followed by 7 is 7%. A roll of 5 followed by 2 is 52%.
    * Special Note: in some game systems, percent rolls like this treat a roll of 00 as 100%. In this system, 00 is 0%.

Die rolls are expressed in the format:

`[#] die type [+/- modifiers]`

> Example: 3d10+2 means: "Roll 3 ten sided dice. Add the result of the three dice together. Add 2."

## Rounding Fractions

In general, if you wind up with a fraction while calculating anything related to character creation or game play, round in the favor of your character.

## Basic Task Resolution
There are two basic ways a character will resolve tasks: ability checks and skill checks. These are used to accomplish actions and/or to resist effects.

### Ability checks

To make an ability check, roll d00 and you must roll less than or equal to your ability score (explained in the abilities section).

### Skill checks

To make a skill check, roll d00 and you must roll less than or equal to your skill score (which is explained in the skills section). See the skills section for more information, and for details on attempting skills without necessary skill levels.

### Resistance Checks

A resistance check is a special kind of ability or skill check. Resistance checks are designed to allow a character a chance to shrug off certain baneful effects. They are handled like any other ability or skill check, and are special to each circumstance. A resistance check does count as an action, and players bombarding an enemy with actions which require resistance checks is one way to whittle down a strong foe's attention and keep him from killing the party.

For instance, a grenade might be listed as causing a certain amount of damage, "half damage with a successful AGL check." That is an AGL-based resistance roll. As another example, a mystical effect might specify that the target of the effect becomes dazed and confused, unable to act "unless they succeed in a WIL check." In these cases, even if the term "resistance check" isn't specified, the roll is treated as one. When a character performs a resistance roll, the GM and player may explain how the resistance check appears. For instance, in the grenade example above the GM might specify that the player dives prone behind a nearby rock. In the mystical effect, the GM or player might say that the character screams through gritted teeth "GET OUT OF MY HEAD" while he whacks at the creature responsible for the mental assault.

**Dodging in Combat -** One very typical type of resistance check is dodging in combat. This is often called a "dodge" within the rules, but is in fact just one common example of a resistance check. When an opponent scores a hit on a target, the target may opt to perform a resistance check in the form of a dodge. This is done with an AGL check, success meaning the target has avoided the attack. Of course, dodging multiple attackers is progressively difficult (as is dodging and attacking in the same turn) because of the multi-action penalty, but that's what makes experienced agile characters truly elite.

**Disadvantage -** Sometimes a resistance check will be specially penalized by a significant disadvantage (that is, some types of effects are more difficult to resist in certain ways than others). This is known as being at a "disadvantage". For instance, a character trying to dodge a bullet is at a disadvantage over dodging a thrust from a spear; both can be deadly but the bullet is by far more difficult to see, anticipate, time, and avoid. In such a case a resistance roll will use one half the appropriate ability as the base chance to resist.

Being at a resistance disadvantage is common in combat under these circumstances: if the defender is unarmed but is trying to dodge a melee attack from an armed attacker; or if the defender is trying to dodge a shot from an aimed firearm. Note that there are exceptions to this rule: a burst from an automatic weapon is different than an aimed shot and therefore might have its own rules.

### Passive Ability and Skill Checks

If the GM wants to know if a player's character notices or knows something, he may make an ability or skill check (see below) and describe the results of that check to the players. This happens without any effort by the player, and therefore doesn't count as an action. The GM does not simply say "Give me a Knowledge: Occult check" or "Make a perception roll". Having the GM perform these types of passive rolls removes any ambiguity over what constitutes an action.

### Modifiers

The GM can assign any bonuses or penalties the situation warrants. Specific modifiers may be given in rules. A modifier is applied to the ability score or skill score before dice are rolled. For example, a STR of 65 with a modifier of -20 means the ability check has a 45% chance to succeed.

**Categorized success modifiers:** For ad-hoc modifier application, GMs may assess the situation and apply one of the following categorized success modifiers.

|--:|:--|
| Easy:         | +20 modifier |
| Normal:       | no modifier |
| Challenging:  | -10 modifier |
| Hard:         | -20 modifier |
| Very Hard:    | -30 modifier |
| Improbable:   | -40 modifier |
| Yeah, right:  | -50 modifier |

## Additional Considerations

The following represents additional rules that are part of the d00 System and should be employed by products derived from this SRD.

### Automatic success/failure

Regardless of the calculated chance of success, any reasonable action check succeeds on any roll of 00-05. Similarly, any action with a reasonable risk of failure will do so on any roll 95-99.

### Critical success/failure

Any time you roll doubles (00, 11, 22, 33, etc.) and succeed in your roll, you have succeeded critically. A critical success means something beneficial occurred, decided by the GM or by specified rules. Any time you roll doubles (77, 88, 99, etc.) and fail, you have failed critically. A critical failure means something baneful occurred, decided by the GM or by specified rules.

### Contests

When two people are pitting their talents and/or training against one another, this is called an action contest. Action contests work just like normal task resolution. The GM determines which ability or skill is appropriate (might be same or different for each contestant). Both parties make a roll. If one succeeds and the other fails, the victor is obvious. Otherwise, play continues until there is a clear victor.

### Cooperation

When multiple people coordinate their efforts, the person with the highest chance of success is referred to as the acting character. Anyone helping is referred to as a helper only if his calculated chance of success is within 20 of the acting character’s chance of success. The acting character's player rolls for success, with a bonus of +10 to his roll for each helper. The GM may decide that there is a limit to how much help one person can receive based on the situation.

### Multi-Actions

Any roll/check made by the player against an ability or skill is called an action. The first action you attempt in a turn uses whatever chance of success exists for that action (no penalty). Your second action is at a -20. Your third action is at a -40, your third at -60, etc. You can therefore attempt as many actions as you wish until the penalty is too steep for you to attempt anything further. The actions are considered to be simultaneous or in direct sequence, so players can't just come back at the end of a turn and announce they want their character to try five or six other things hoping to just roll luckily. Note that resistance checks do count as actions and do carry a multi-action penalty.

### Extended Actions

An extended action will require a number of successes in order to succeed. For instance, lock-picking a security lock might require a 2-point extended action. Another (more complex) security lock might require a 3-point extended action, etc.

Each turn, the character is permitted to make a check (the GM will decide which type of check it is). If he succeeds, he gets a point. If he fails, he loses a point (if he has any to lose). Once he's accumulated enough points to fulfill the needs of the extended action, he's finally succeeded in that action. Of course, if his chance to succeed is quite low, he player will likely give up trying before succeeding in a long extended action.

Note that the character can skip a turn if he has to accomplish something unrelated, then continue where he left off. For instance, a character working a few turns on a 3-point extended lock pick might have to stop his efforts for one turn while he shoots at some goons. That turn he neither gains or loses a point. Next turn he can continue as normal. However, some actions might reset themselves with an interruption. The GM should inform the player of such a situation before they decide they wish to interrupt their activities.

Extended actions only apply in combat; when outside of a combat situation, any task is resolved with a single roll of the dice – even extended actions.

# Abilities

All characters have scores in the following eight abilities (sometimes called characteristics or ability scores):

## Abilities

The following is the standard core ability set for games using the d00 System SRD.

### Strength

This ability represents raw power and muscle, developed or natural. A character with a high score can punch harder or lift greater weights than his weakling friends. Characters with high strength tend to look the part, having well-developed physiques that do not go unnoticed. Strength is a physical ability and is abbreviated STR.

### Endurance

This ability represents stamina and energy. A character with a high score can recover from exhaustion quicker, resist toxins better, or endure pain longer than his wimpy friends. Endurance also represents resistance to damage before the body shuts down from trauma (that is, it is used to determine Body Points). Endurance is a physical ability and is abbreviated END.

### Dexterity

This ability represents general hand-eye coordination. A character with a high score can aim better or pick a pocket defter than his clumsy friends. Although very beneficial in combat, dexterity is no more important to a warrior than the other physical abilities. Dexterity is a physical ability and is abbreviated DEX.

### Agility

This ability represents quickness of the body, its balance, grace, flexibility and maneuverability. It is the celerity with which that messages from the brain are acted upon, and the general fluidity of motion of the body’s muscles. Characters with high scores in agility tend to be the fastest runners, best dodgers, and the first one to act in a tense situation. Agility is a physical ability and is abbreviated AGL.

### Perception

This ability represents the five senses, in addition to raw intuition. A character with a high score can sense the presence of an enemy in a concealed location, guess the whereabouts of a proverbial needle in a haystack, or sense the weak spot in an enemy's defenses. Characters with high ratings in perception tend not to be surprised in ambush situations and are often sent ahead of a group to scout for his dull-witted friends. Perception is a mental ability and is abbreviated PER.

### Logic

This ability represents knowledge and the powers of deductive reasoning. Characters with high scores in logic tend to learn faster, remember better, break complex ciphers faster, and program computers more effectively than their stupid friends. Logic is a mental ability and is abbreviated LOG.

### Charisma

This ability represents the character's personality, charm, wit, and fellowship. Characters with high scores in charisma tend to make friends easier, persuade more effectively, and get along well with others more effortlessly than their jerk friends. Charisma is a mental ability and is abbreviated CHA

### Willpower

This ability represents the strength of a character's personality, his presence, leadership, and ability through direct or indirect intentions to inspire others to act, either out of respect, fear, or some combination of the two. Characters with high scores in willpower tend to rise in military ranks faster, interrogate more effectively, endure mental duress better, and attract followers more easily than their weak-willed friends. Willpower is a mental ability and is abbreviated WIL.

## Lite Ability Set

In some game genres, a smaller/simpler ability set may be desired. If this is desired, the following "lite" ability set can be used:

| Ability | Abbr. | Description |
|:--|:---:|:---|
| Strength   | STR  | treat this as a combination of STR and END from above. |
| Dexterity  | DEX  | treat this as a combination of DEX and AGL from above. |
| Logic      | LOG  | treat this as a combination of PER and LOG from above. |
| Willpower  | WIL  | treat this as a combination of CHA and WIL from above. |

## Scores

Scores are rated as a percent. Each score generally ranges from 35% - 75% for starting characters in a game which simulates any level of reality. Scores above 100 are possible.

### Starting Ability Scores

Individual games created using this d00 System SRD can have their own ability score generation methods. As an example, the following can be used.

Roll d00 on the random ability score table once for each of the eight abilities, then arrange them as desired to help meet an envisioned character concept:

| d00 | Score | Comments |
|:--|:---:|:---|
|00-09 | 35% | Feeble |
|10-19 | 40% | Low |
|20-34 | 45% | Below Average |
|35-54 | 50% | Typical |
|55-69 | 55% | Above Average |
|70-79 | 60% | High |
|80-89 | 65% | Good |
|90-94 | 70% | Excellent |
|95-99 | 75% | Remarkable |


Derived Abilities
In addition to the primary abilities (or the lite ability set) defined above, characters in games created from the d00 System SRD have a few other abilities which are derived from those described above. These are called derived abilities.

Body Points
Body Points (abbreviated BP) is simply the number of points of damage your character can sustain before he falls unconscious (or worse!). Body Points are calculated by using half the character's END score (if using the lite ability set, half the STR score). When a character reaches 0 BP, he is unconscious. When the action is over, the character must make an END check to awaken with 1 BP. If the check is failed, the character is dead.

For instance, a character with an END score of 55 has 28 BP.

Initiative
Most characters have an initiative score of 1. This is the number of dice rolled to determine who goes first in combat. Very perceptive characters (PER 65% or higher) or very quick characters (AGL 65% or higher) have an initiative score of 2. A character who is both very quick and very perceptive (both scores 65% or higher) has a 3 initiative score and is extraordinarily fast. Initiative is explained more in the combat section.

Note that if using the lite ability set, LOG and AGL are used to determine Initiative.

Movement
Time and distance can vary among games created using the d00 System SRD. One game might use meters per turn, another might use feet per second, etc. Still others might use an abstract unit of "spaces" per turn, designed for miniature use. Because of this, individual games will have totally different measurements of time and distance for movement considerations. What follows is a well-tested default movement resolution system that can serve as a default for any game derived from this SRD.

Characters have movement rates listed in three values: normal, fast, and hourly. A character who is moving normally is walking. Characters may move this walking distance in a combat turn for free. A player who wants his character to move faster must make an AGL check. If he succeeds, he may move up to his fast movement rate, but if he fails, he moves only twice his normal rate.

For instance, a character might have a movement rate of 10m/turn, 30m/turn, 5kph. He may move up to 10 meters for free. If the player wants to move further, he makes an AGL check. If he succeeds, he'll move 30 meters. If he fails, he'll move only 20 meters (twice his normal rate).
The character's hourly rate is for exploring on larger scale maps. It assumes a cautious pace. If a player wishes his character to increase his rate, he may make an END check. If he succeeds, he can double his hourly rate. If he fails, he moves his normal hourly rate.

Melee Damage Modifier
When using melee weapons or bare hands, characters who are very strong will hurt their enemies more than characters who are very weak. Therefore, melee damage is modified by a character's Strength score according to the following table.

Strength	Melee Damage Modifier
01-05	-5
06-15	-4
16-25	-3
26-35	-2
36-45	-1
46-55	+0
56-65	+1
66-75	+2
76-85	+3
86-95	+4
96-105	+5
Each +10	+1
Ranged Damage Modifier
When using ranged weapons such as bows or firearms, characters who are very dextrous will hurt their enemies more than characters who are very uncoordinated, by hitting them more effectively. Therefore, ranged damage is modified by a character's Dexterity score according to the following table.

Dexterity	Ranged Damage Modifier
01-05	-5
06-15	-4
16-25	-3
26-35	-2
36-45	-1
46-55	+0
56-65	+1
66-75	+2
76-85	+3
86-95	+4
96-105	+5
Each +10	+1
